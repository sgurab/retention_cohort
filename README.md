# retention_cohort
As a manager, there are some questions you must be able to answer. One of them is: when are my clients going away? A cohort analysis should help.

Here, I will share an method to do this evaluation in google bigquery using the date that the client got in and the date the client got out, focusing in cases that the client relation with the company is made through a contract. Why am I specifying it? Because I saw plenty of cohort analysis in an application context, were retention is measured by client activity in weeks. Here, we will focus in a monthly cohort.
